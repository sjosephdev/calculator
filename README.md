This is a simple JavaScript calculator, written from scratch and in a way I felt was more intuitive than some other examples I have seen since creating it (incorporating basic OOP practices). The calculator also features what I call a "running equation" that shows the inputed operands and operators. 

The design focus is straightforward and responsive / moble-friendly. 

Languages used:
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
